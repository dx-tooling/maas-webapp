# MCP Instance Types Configuration (.dist)

# Copy this file to mcp_instance_type_configurations.yaml and adjust as needed.

# Schema overview:
# mcp_instance_types:                       # required
#   <instanceTypeKey>:                      # must match App\McpInstances\Domain\Enum\InstanceType values
#     display_name: <string>                # required, shown in UI
#     docker:                               # required
#       image: <string>                     # required, docker image name
#       env:                                # optional map<string,string>, extra env passed to container
#         SOME_ENV: "value"
#     endpoints:                            # required map keyed by endpoint id (e.g., mcp, vnc, ...)
#       <endpointId>:                       # id also defines the first subdomain segment
#         port: <int>                       # required internal container port for this endpoint
#         auth: <string|null>               # optional, e.g., "bearer" to enable ForwardAuth; omit or null for none
#         external_paths:                   # required list of external URL paths to show in UI
#           - "/path"
#         health:                           # optional
#           http:                           # optional
#             path: "/health-or-root"     # required when http present; must start with '/'
#             accept_status_lt: 500         # optional int in [100..599], default 500
#
# Conventions used by the app:
# - Hostnames are derived as: <endpointId>-<instanceSlug>.<rootDomain>
# - Traefik labels are generated from endpoints; ForwardAuth applies when auth == "bearer" (or for endpointId == "mcp").
# - The presence of an endpoint with id "mcp" is required for each instance type.
