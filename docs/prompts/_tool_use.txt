Use these tools as your disposal:

`nvm use && ./.dxcli/dxcli.sh frontend` (builds all client-side css and js stuff; run this whenever you change TypeScript/JavaScript or CSS stuff, BEFORE running the tests or requesting pages)

`nvm use && ./.dxcli/dxcli.sh quality` (PHP CS Fixer, PHPStan, tsc checks, etc.)

`./.dxcli/dxcli.sh test` (run the test suite (Unit, Integration, Application))

`php vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit tests/End2End` (run the end2end (Panther) test suite)

A local webserver is already up and running, allowing you to look at webpages and trigger API endpoints, for example:

`curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/live-demo/session-flow-ui`

`curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/live-demo/api/sessions/`

`curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/live-demo/api/sessions/12345/messages`

etc.

But you can also use the Playwright MCP server tool in order to browse your work with a real browser!

You can read up on how to write end2end tests with Panther like this:
